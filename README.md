# Medical-Transcription

## Introduction
In the vast domain of healthcare data, medical transcriptions offer a wealth of information that, if accurately extracted and analyzed, can significantly enhance patient care and medical research. This project aims to tap into this potential by developing a sophisticated approach to extract specific age and treatment information from unstructured medical transcriptions and descriptions. At the heart of our solution is the innovative use of BioBERT, a state-of-the-art language model pre-trained on extensive biomedical corpora, combined with the simplicity and effectiveness of a Logistic Regression classifier.

The choice of BioBERT as the foundation for our approach stems from its deep understanding of biomedical context, honed through training on vast amounts of biomedical literature. This understanding enables BioBERT to generate highly contextualized embeddings for sentences within medical transcriptions and descriptions, capturing the nuances of medical terminology and treatment descriptions.

Building on BioBERT's embeddings, we employ Logistic Regression as our classification model. This choice is motivated by the model's interpretability, efficiency, and robust performance as a baseline in machine learning tasks. Despite its simplicity, Logistic Regression offers a powerful tool for distinguishing between age extraction, treatment-related and unrelated sentences, leveraging the rich representations provided by BioBERT embeddings.

This project embodies a bridge between advanced NLP techniques and practical healthcare applications. By extracting clear, actionable treatment and age information from the complex language of medical transcriptions and descriptions.

### BioBERT
BioBERT (Biomedical Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) represents a significant advancement in the application of natural language processing (NLP) to biomedical texts. It's a derivative of BERT, a model known for its deep understanding of language contexts, further trained on extensive biomedical literature. This specialized training makes BioBERT adept at parsing and understanding the complexities of medical language, ranging from clinical notes to research articles. BioBERT is pre-trained on vast biomedical corpora, including PubMed abstracts and PMC full-text articles. This pre-training equips BioBERT with an inherent understanding of biomedical terminology and context, crucial for accurately interpreting medical transcriptions.

Experiment Settings:

* Corpus: The experiment leverages medical transcriptions, with texts needing preprocessing to fit BioBERTâ€™s input requirements.
* Pre-trained Model: `dmis-lab/biobert-v1.1` is utilized for generating embeddings from sentences within the medical transcriptions.
* Fine-tuning: While BioBERT provides the base embeddings, fine-tuning was considered based on the project's specific need to classify sentences as treatment-related or not. If additional labeled data were available, BioBERT could be fine-tuned accordingly.

Performance Justification:

* Enhanced Domain Relevance: BioBERT's training on biomedical texts results in a model that is inherently more suited to understanding medical transcriptions than general-purpose language models. This domain-specific pre-training translates to higher accuracy in tasks like entity recognition or information extraction within the biomedical field.
* When compared to general-purpose models like BERT or GPT, BioBERT demonstrates superior performance in biomedical NLP tasks, underscoring the importance of domain-specific pre-training.
* The utilization of BioBERT, combined with a Logistic Regression classifier for treatment information extraction, strikes a balance between leveraging deep, contextualized language understanding and maintaining model simplicity and interpretability for classification decisions.

### Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is straightforward to implement and interpret. For a task like age extraction and identifying treatment-related sentences, it provides a clear probability score for classification decisions, making it easier to adjust thresholds for precision and recall based on the task's requirements. It is computationally efficient, making it suitable for initial experiments and quicker iterations over the model. Logistic Regression often serves as a good baseline model. Its performance on the task can provide a benchmark to evaluate more complex models against.

Experiment Settings:

* Features: Age extraction and sentence embeddings obtained from BioBERT.
* Labels: Extracting age from description and trancription Binary labels indicating whether a sentence is treatment-related.
* Training Procedure: The dataset is split into training and testing sets. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set.

Performance Justification:

* Given its efficiency and interpretability, Logistic Regression is well-suited for tasks where a quick baseline is needed. Its performance can guide the necessity for more complex models. If Logistic Regression performs well, it might indicate that the decision boundary between the classes is relatively simple or linear in the transformed space, negating the need for more complex models.

Alternative Methods: Support Vector Machines (SVM):

* Pros: SVM is effective in high-dimensional spaces, making it suitable for sentence embeddings. It's capable of modeling non-linear decision boundaries using kernel tricks.
* Cons: Model parameters (like the choice of kernel) and regularization terms can be sensitive, requiring careful tuning.
* Performance: SVM might outperform Logistic Regression if the decision boundary between treatment-related and unrelated sentences is complex or non-linear.
